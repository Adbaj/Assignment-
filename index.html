    <H4>Biography:</H4>
    <p>
        My name is Adedamola Bajowa. I am an aspiring cloud engineer. I have in me
        an innate desire and passion for the technological world. From an early age, I have     
        been invested in understanding the nature of systems and how they play a part in every
        product we have, especially technology.
        <br>
        I have always enjoyed Computer as a child because it was a subject unlike the rest.
        The focus was to break down the entire framework to ensure that we all understood, from
        scratch, how everything played a role to create the system we see. This was one of the
        biggest drivers which pulled me to Cloud engineering, and particularly, a role in tech.
        <br>
        Outside the realm of tech and academia, I am a very introspective person who enjoys
        exploring ideas and having intellectual discussions.

    <h4>Why I joined the Program</h4>
    <p>
        I joined the Altschool Program because I have a feverish innate desire in me to 
        becoming a renouned engineer in the tech space. I have always been facinated with
        the intricate details involved within tech, and a top in the notch educational
        institution like Altschool was the ideal platform to acquire my knowledge.
        <br>
        I was also drawn as a consequence of the collaborative learning environment that 
        AltSchool provides it's students. It provides a platform where individuals and students
        can exchange ideas, while growing not only personally, but professionally as well. I knew 
        that with this approach, I was on the right track to achieving the goals I had set out for 
        myself.
